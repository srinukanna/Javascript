//let character = "Hello";let count = 8;let rows = [];
/*Step 31
Declaring a variable with the let keyword allows it to be reassigned. This means you could change character later to be a completely different value.

For this project, you will not want to change these variable values. So instead, you should use const to declare them. const variables are special.

First, a const variable cannot be reassigned like a let variable. This code would throw an error:

Example Code
const firstName = "Naomi";
firstName = "Jessica";
A const variable also cannot be uninitialized. This code would throw an error:

Example Code
const firstName;
Replace your let keywords with const.
console.log(kanna1);
console.log(kanna);

function kannalegend()
{
    console.log(kanna.length);
}
